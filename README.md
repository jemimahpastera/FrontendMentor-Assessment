## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I still have a lot of things to improve and learn, and maybe in the future, challenges could help my coding skills be at ease.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools is my one-go website, and it helps me to render everything, such as margin, padding, colours, etc.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Since I use the CSS framework, and might as well insert Bootstrap for future reference. Plus, it also helps me, especially for media queries.
